**Can You Use Functional Skills to Get Into University in the UK?**

If you're worried about not having traditional GCSEs and wondering whether you can still go to university — the answer is yes. **Functional Skills qualifications** are widely accepted by many universities across the UK as **GCSE equivalents**, particularly for Maths and English.

**Why Universities Accept Functional Skills**

Functional Skills were designed as an alternative for learners who didn’t take or pass GCSEs the first time around. These Level 2 qualifications are **Ofqual-regulated**, **nationally recognised**, and mapped to the same level as GCSE grade 4 (C) and above.

That means most universities that ask for GCSE Maths and English will accept **Level 2 Functional Skills** instead.

Whether you're applying for a nursing course, social work degree, or teacher training programme, you can meet the entry requirements by passing your [Functional Skills English Level 2 Exam](https://www.intechcentre.com/courses/functional-skills-english-level-2-exam/) and [Functional Skills Maths Level 2 Exam](https://www.intechcentre.com/courses/functional-skills-maths-level-2-exam/).
