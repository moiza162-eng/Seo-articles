## Functional Skills Maths vs GCSE Maths

Both GCSE and Functional Skills Maths are recognised qualifications, but there are important differences that matter for learners:

* **GCSE Maths:** Often academic, includes topics not always relevant to everyday life. Usually studied over two years in schools.
* **Functional Skills Maths Level 2:** Focused on real-life application, flexible study, and faster results. Many learners can pass within weeks with the right preparation.

Employers and universities accept both, but for adult learners, **level 2 functional skills maths** is often the quicker and more practical route. Passing it shows employers you have essential numeracy without the long commitment of retaking GCSEs.
